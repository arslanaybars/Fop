|NotContains        |`!~=`       | ✔️ | ✔️    | ❌  | ❌    | ❌ |
|StartsWith         |`_=`        | ✔️ | ✔️    | ❌  | ❌    | ❌ |
|NotStartsWith      |`!_=`       | ✔️ | ✔️    | ❌  | ❌    | ❌ |

##### Example
api/students/

?Filter=Midterm>10;and 

&Order=Midterm;desc

&PageNumber=1

&PageSize=2`

The above expression returns us students whose midterms is more than 10, then order by Midterm descending with page number is 1 and page size is 2.

It works! 🚀
